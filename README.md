## Reimplementation of "Efficient Neural Architecture Search via Parameter Sharing" (Pham et al., 2018) in Pytorch.
In addition to reimplementing the original paper, we conduct experiments using a PPO-based controller. Our findings were presented at the Scientific Students' Associaton's annual conference at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics. The paper can be found [here](http://tdk.bme.hu/VIK/DownloadPaper/Neuralis-architektura-kereses-minta1
