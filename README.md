# ENAS implementation in Pytorch


## Main repository for our university research in the topic of neural architecture search

Our work is mainly inspired by two papers:
- [Neural Architecture Search with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.01578.pdf)
- [Efficient Neural Architecture Search via Parameter Sharing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.03268.pdf)
